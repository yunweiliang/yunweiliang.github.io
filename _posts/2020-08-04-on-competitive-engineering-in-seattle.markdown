## Problem Space

Quarantine got me chasing after habbits.


I found myself to be a small subset of people who is fortunate enough to be surrounded by books gathered over the years. But not so much that I wanted to throw the so called "classics" out of my window.

With the libraries closed during quarantine, I weigh between buying a new book or reading one on Overdrive (a library ebook app). 

I was raised to be conscious of subtle actions, such as physical book trading, that contribute to carbon footprint => don't buy a new book.

But I like disconnecting for a quiet afternoon with a book I can carry in my hands, with no WiFi or blue light => don't read an/ebook/audiobook.

But libraries are closed!!

Maybe I can make new friends through a book club! How? My friends don't read books, and I don't know anyone who reads books I like :(

It was then I saw some people started getting books for each other on instagram within my friend groups: 

> Buy me a book, share on social media as I did, and more people will buy you books!

This gave me idea to utilize our existing network to build an unconventional book club that circulates our own books. Here are the problems with sharing books with your friends:

> In a few months, I could no longer find my books and then discovered in their families donation pile. How disrespectful!

> ...passionate about sharing - but also getting back - beloved books.

Some people resort to the following solutions:

> Jean Jacobs: a curse to those who don't return the books => all books returned.
